# WTF
Web pages to help work with KiCAD 6. Main idea create somthing simple, to fast transport from datasheet table to KiCAD symbol. 

No need install apache/nginx and other stuff. Just download and use.

Start from index.html and choose tools.

# List of tools
 * Connector symbol generator by RU GOST, or something like that
 * Group pin by name or info
